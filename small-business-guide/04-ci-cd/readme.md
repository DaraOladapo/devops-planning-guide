# CI/CD Implementation - Small Business

## Overview

Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment (CI/CD) for small businesses should be simple, reliable, and cost-effective. This section provides practical guidance for implementing CI/CD without the complexity of enterprise solutions.

## Basic CI/CD Pipeline

### Simple Pipeline Structure
```
Code Push → Build → Test → Deploy to Staging → Manual Approval → Deploy to Production
```

### GitHub Actions Example

Here's a basic GitHub Actions workflow for a small business:

```yaml
name: CI/CD Pipeline

on:
  push:
    branches: [ main, develop ]
  pull_request:
    branches: [ main ]

jobs:
  test:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Setup Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v3
      with:
        node-version: '18'
        cache: 'npm'
    - run: npm install
    - run: npm test
    - run: npm run build

  deploy-staging:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/develop'
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Deploy to Staging
      run: |
        # Your deployment script here
        echo "Deploying to staging..."

  deploy-production:
    needs: test
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    if: github.ref == 'refs/heads/main'
    environment: production
    steps:
    - uses: actions/checkout@v3
    - name: Deploy to Production
      run: |
        # Your deployment script here
        echo "Deploying to production..."
```

## Implementation Steps

### Phase 1: Continuous Integration (Week 1)

#### 1. Set Up Build Pipeline
**Goal**: Automate building and testing

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml` file
- [ ] Configure automatic builds on every push
- [ ] Add basic test execution
- [ ] Set up build artifact storage
- [ ] Configure build notifications

**Tools**: GitHub Actions (free for public repos, 2000 minutes/month for private)

#### 2. Quality Gates
**Goal**: Prevent bad code from moving forward

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Add linting to pipeline
- [ ] Implement code coverage reporting
- [ ] Set up security scanning
- [ ] Configure branch protection rules
- [ ] Require status checks for merging

**Tools**: ESLint, SonarCloud, GitHub Security Features

### Phase 2: Continuous Deployment (Week 2)

#### 3. Staging Environment
**Goal**: Test deployments in production-like environment

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Set up staging environment (cloud-based)
- [ ] Configure automatic deployment to staging
- [ ] Set up environment variables
- [ ] Implement basic smoke tests
- [ ] Create staging database/data

**Tools**: AWS/Azure/GCP, Docker, environment configs

#### 4. Production Deployment
**Goal**: Deploy to production safely

**Checklist**:
- [ ] Set up production environment
- [ ] Implement manual approval gates
- [ ] Configure rollback procedures
- [ ] Set up production monitoring
- [ ] Create deployment notifications

## Small Business CI/CD Strategies

### 1. Trunk-Based Development
**Best for**: Small teams (2-8 developers)

**Approach**:
- Single main branch
- Short-lived feature branches
- Frequent integration
- Feature flags for incomplete features

**Benefits**:
- Simple branching model
- Fast integration
- Reduced merge conflicts
- Quick feedback

### 2. GitFlow Lite
**Best for**: Teams with regular releases

**Approach**:
- Main branch for production
- Develop branch for integration
- Feature branches for new work
- Hotfix branches for urgent fixes

**Benefits**:
- Clear separation of environments
- Controlled releases
- Easy hotfixes

## Tool Recommendations

### Free/Low-Cost CI/CD Tools

#### GitHub Actions
- **Pros**: Native GitHub integration, generous free tier
- **Cons**: Can get expensive with heavy usage
- **Best for**: GitHub-based projects
- **Cost**: Free for public, $0.008/minute for private repos

#### GitLab CI/CD
- **Pros**: Comprehensive DevOps platform, good free tier
- **Cons**: Learning curve for complex pipelines
- **Best for**: Teams wanting all-in-one solution
- **Cost**: Free tier includes 400 CI/CD minutes

#### CircleCI
- **Pros**: Fast builds, easy configuration
- **Cons**: Limited free tier
- **Best for**: Teams prioritizing speed
- **Cost**: Free tier includes 6,000 build minutes/month

### Cloud Platform Options

#### AWS
- **Services**: CodePipeline, CodeBuild, CodeDeploy
- **Pros**: Comprehensive, integrates well with other AWS services
- **Cons**: Can be complex for simple needs
- **Cost**: Pay-as-you-go pricing

#### Azure DevOps
- **Services**: Azure Pipelines, Azure Repos
- **Pros**: Great for Microsoft stack, generous free tier
- **Cons**: Less popular than GitHub Actions
- **Cost**: Free for small teams (5 users)

#### Google Cloud Build
- **Services**: Cloud Build, Cloud Deploy
- **Pros**: Simple, good integration with GCP
- **Cons**: Smaller ecosystem
- **Cost**: 120 build minutes per day free

## Deployment Strategies

### 1. Simple Deployment
**Process**: Replace old version with new version
**Downtime**: Yes (brief)
**Complexity**: Low
**Best for**: Internal tools, low-traffic applications

### 2. Blue-Green Deployment
**Process**: Run two identical environments, switch traffic
**Downtime**: No
**Complexity**: Medium
**Best for**: Customer-facing applications

### 3. Rolling Deployment
**Process**: Gradually replace instances
**Downtime**: No
**Complexity**: Medium
**Best for**: Load-balanced applications

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Essential Metrics
- Build success rate
- Deployment frequency
- Lead time for changes
- Mean time to recovery (MTTR)
- Failed deployment percentage

### Simple Monitoring Setup
```yaml
# Add to your pipeline
- name: Health Check
  run: |
    curl -f https://your-app.com/health || exit 1
    
- name: Notify on Failure
  if: failure()
  uses: 8398a7/action-slack@v3
  with:
    status: failure
    text: 'Deployment failed!'
```

## Security Considerations

### Secrets Management
- [ ] Use GitHub Secrets for sensitive data
- [ ] Rotate secrets regularly
- [ ] Limit secret access to necessary workflows
- [ ] Never commit secrets to code

### Access Control
- [ ] Require reviews for production deployments
- [ ] Use environment protection rules
- [ ] Implement least-privilege access
- [ ] Enable audit logging

## Troubleshooting Common Issues

### Build Failures
- Check logs for specific error messages
- Verify dependencies are correctly specified
- Ensure test data is available
- Check for environment-specific issues

### Deployment Failures
- Verify target environment is accessible
- Check deployment scripts for errors
- Ensure database migrations complete
- Verify configuration is correct

### Performance Issues
- Monitor build times and optimize slow steps
- Use caching for dependencies
- Parallelize independent jobs
- Consider using faster runners

## Cost Optimization

### Tips for Small Businesses
1. **Use caching**: Cache dependencies between builds
2. **Optimize containers**: Use smaller base images
3. **Monitor usage**: Track CI/CD minutes usage
4. **Choose right instance sizes**: Don't over-provision
5. **Clean up resources**: Remove unused environments

### Sample Monthly Costs
- **Startup (1-3 developers)**: $0-50
- **Small team (3-8 developers)**: $50-200
- **Growing team (8-15 developers)**: $200-500
