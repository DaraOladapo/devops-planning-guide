# Process Management - Small Business

## Overview

Effective process management for small businesses focuses on lightweight, practical approaches that don't slow down development but provide structure and visibility. The goal is to balance agility with predictability.

## Agile for Small Teams

### Recommended Framework: Simplified Scrum

#### Sprint Structure (1-2 weeks)
- **Sprint Planning**: 1-2 hours at sprint start
- **Daily Standups**: 15 minutes maximum
- **Sprint Review**: 30-60 minutes to demo work
- **Sprint Retrospective**: 30 minutes to improve process

#### Roles (Simplified)
- **Product Owner**: Usually founder/CEO or lead business person
- **Scrum Master**: Can be developer or PM (part-time role)
- **Development Team**: All developers and designers

### Alternative: Kanban for Continuous Flow

#### When to Use Kanban
- Continuous delivery requirements
- Variable work priorities
- Support and maintenance focused
- Very small teams (2-4 people)

#### Simple Kanban Board
```
| Backlog | Ready | In Progress | In Review | Done |
|---------|-------|-------------|-----------|------|
|   üìã    |  ‚è≥   |     üîß      |    üëÄ     |  ‚úÖ  |
```

## Work Item Management

### GitHub Issues (Free Option)

#### Issue Templates
Create `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` with:

**Bug Report Template:**
```markdown
---
name: Bug Report
about: Create a report to help us improve
title: '[BUG] '
labels: bug
assignees: ''
---

**Describe the bug**
A clear description of what the bug is.

**Steps to Reproduce**
1. Go to '...'
2. Click on '....'
3. See error

**Expected behavior**
What you expected to happen.

**Screenshots**
If applicable, add screenshots.
```

**Feature Request Template:**
```markdown
---
name: Feature Request
about: Suggest a new feature
title: '[FEATURE] '
labels: enhancement
assignees: ''
---

**Problem Description**
What problem does this solve?

**Proposed Solution**
What would you like to happen?

**Business Value**
Why is this important to our customers/business?
```

#### Labels System
- **Priority**: `high`, `medium`, `low`
- **Type**: `bug`, `feature`, `tech-debt`, `documentation`
- **Status**: `ready`, `in-progress`, `blocked`, `review`
- **Size**: `small`, `medium`, `large`

### GitHub Projects (Free Kanban)

#### Simple Board Setup
1. Create project board
2. Add automated columns:
   - **Backlog**: Newly added issues
   - **Ready**: Issues ready for work
   - **In Progress**: Currently being worked on
   - **In Review**: Pull requests open
   - **Done**: Closed issues/merged PRs

## Release Management

### Simple Release Strategy

#### Semantic Versioning
- **Major** (1.0.0): Breaking changes
- **Minor** (0.1.0): New features
- **Patch** (0.0.1): Bug fixes

#### Release Process
1. **Weekly/Bi-weekly releases** from main branch
2. **Hotfixes** directly to main with immediate deployment
3. **Feature flags** for incomplete features

## Quality Gates

### Pull Request Process

#### Branch Protection Rules
Enable in GitHub repository settings:
- [ ] Require pull request reviews before merging
- [ ] Require status checks to pass before merging
- [ ] Require up-to-date branches before merging

#### PR Template
Create `.github/pull_request_template.md`:
```markdown
