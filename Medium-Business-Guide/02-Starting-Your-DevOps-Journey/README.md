```

#### Infrastructure as Code
```hcl
# Example: Terraform module structure
module "application_infrastructure" {
  source = "./modules/application"
  
  environment     = var.environment
  application_name = var.application_name
  instance_count  = var.instance_count
  
  # Security groups, load balancers, databases, etc.
}

module "monitoring" {
  source = "./modules/monitoring"
  
  application_name = var.application_name
  alert_email     = var.alert_email
}
```
